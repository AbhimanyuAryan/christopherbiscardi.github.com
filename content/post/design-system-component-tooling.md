Not all new products need a design system. Most should use anything else whether
that is browser/native built-ins or a preset system like Bootstrap. Eventually
after using these systems for awhile you hit a point where the primitives no
longer match the intent. Maybe your product is functional and now you want to
differentiate through design or you've used tools like Bootstrap enough to
realize where it will break down in the future.
