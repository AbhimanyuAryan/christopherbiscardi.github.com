{"data":{"root":{"post":{"body":"<p>Recently I was asked to build a CRUD app.</p>\n<p>The task was open to using any tech I wanted on the backend, so my first thought was a distributed service in Erlang with a WebMachine interface. This would satisfy the REST requirements for the location service, which we could access via an application server for web.</p>\n<p>However, the preferred method for this task was described to be Python/Flask, So we’ll use that.</p>\n<p>Since sessions are not technically RESTful, they cannot be included in a user authentication scheme. Client side on mobile devices is a different story, with iOS using keychain for security and Android advocating OAuth-type approaches. As it happens, the task language doesn’t include the concept of users, just locations, so we’ll skip authentication to make it REST-Compliant (note: REST doesn’t have a spec.)</p>\n<p>Attributes of a favorite location object include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>id</li>\n<li>lat</li>\n<li>lng</li>\n<li>address (e.g. 800 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94114)</li>\n<li>name (e.g. Work)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This could easily fit in a SQL database, but since we’re using Geolocation and I happen to know that MongoDB’s Geo facilities would allow us to query based on distance from our current position, we’ll use Mongo. Alternatively, we could have also used ElasticSearch/Solr/Lucene but Mongo will serve our purposes just fine.</p>\n<p>We will be deploying on Heroku to use the free ssl support and addons. In reality Heroku is a test platform due to being hosted on EC2 US East only. We will also be skipping the CDN (CloudFront/S3/etc) as the total users here will be under 5.</p>\n<p>I’ve never used Flask before, so this will take a little longer than normal. If I was going for turnaround time, I might have used node.js and express or RESTify because I’m stronger with JS/node.</p>\n<p>To connect to the Mongo Instance on Heroku || localhost:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight__hljs___FzKxy index__p2___65FBl\"><code>  <span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">import</span> pymongo\n\n  <span class=\"highlight__hljs-comment___UYk12\"># Get MongoDB URL if on Heroku, else use localhost</span>\n  MONGO_URL = os.environ.get(<span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'MONGOHQ_URL'</span>)\n\n   <span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">if</span> MONGO_URL:\n       <span class=\"highlight__hljs-comment___UYk12\"># Get a connection</span>\n       conn = pymongo.Connection(MONGO_URL)\n\n       <span class=\"highlight__hljs-comment___UYk12\"># Get the database</span>\n       db = conn[urlparse(MONGO_URL).path[<span class=\"highlight__hljs-number___2gmaH\">1</span>:]]\n   <span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">else</span>:\n       <span class=\"highlight__hljs-comment___UYk12\"># Not on an app with the MongoHQ add-on, do some localhost action</span>\n       conn = pymongo.Connection(<span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'localhost'</span>, <span class=\"highlight__hljs-number___2gmaH\">27017</span>)\n       db = conn[<span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'test'</span>]\n  <span class=\"highlight__hljs-comment___UYk12\"># locations Collection</span>\n  locationsC = db.locations\n</code></pre>\n<p>And set up some content negotiation formatters:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight__hljs___FzKxy index__p2___65FBl\"><code><span class=\"highlight__hljs-comment___UYk12\"># Content Negotiation Formatters</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"highlight__hljs-class___mOeOV\"><span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">class</span> <span class=\"highlight__hljs-title___1fl8Q\">JSONFormatter</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Formatter)</span>:</span>\n    format = <span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'json'</span>\n    mimetypes = [<span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'application/json'</span>]\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">def</span> <span class=\"highlight__hljs-title___1fl8Q\">render</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(self, obj)</span>:</span>\n        <span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">return</span> json.dumps(obj)\n\n\n<span class=\"highlight__hljs-class___mOeOV\"><span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">class</span> <span class=\"highlight__hljs-title___1fl8Q\">HTMLFormatter</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(Formatter)</span>:</span>\n    format = <span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'json'</span>\n    mimetypes = [<span class=\"highlight__hljs-string___1SffY\">'text/html'</span>]\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">def</span> <span class=\"highlight__hljs-title___1fl8Q\">configure</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(self, template)</span>:</span>\n        self.template = template\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">def</span> <span class=\"highlight__hljs-title___1fl8Q\">render</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(self, obj)</span>:</span>\n        <span class=\"highlight__hljs-keyword___som98\">return</span> render_template(self.template, **obj)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Having got some server basics out of the way I started on the structure of the home page.
